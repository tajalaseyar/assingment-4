            Yves Saint Laurent was a French fashion designer who founded his eponymous fashion label in 196212. He is regarded as one of the foremost fashion designers of the twentieth century1. Saint Laurent gained acclaim for his dress designs and popularized women's trousers for all occasions3. He was Christian Dior's design assistant and took over as creative director when Dior died suddenly in 195734. Saint Laurent was the first living designer to receive a solo exhibition in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 19832.
